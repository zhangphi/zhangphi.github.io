# A Brief Introduction to Orange

One of my colleagues told me a couple of weeks back that they
are interested in [Orange](https://github.com/biolab/orange3 ) and asked if we can help them. I have installed it on my computer this week 
and played with it a little bit.

Orange can be used as a Python library, but to be honest, I don't find much value of it on that as there are many excellent libraries 
on data analytics such as pandas and scikit-learn etc.

On the other hand, Orange works as an excellent visualization tool via orange-canvas. It provides an integrated platform for data preprocessing,
data analytics, model training and evaluation, visualization with a large set of widgets. One can construct his work pipeline super easily 
with these widgets, just like kids playing legos. Some learning videos can be found at [Orange data Mining](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLmNPvQr9Tf-ZSDLwOzxpvYHrE0yv-8Fy)

Moreover, Orange provides a bunch of add-ons such as Educational, Image Analytics, Text, Textable, Explain (for XAI), so one can easily
set up his own pipeline for data science projects in NLP and Image Processing etc. although I'm not sure yet how to incorporate Orange and LLM at the 
moment.

It is definitely an excellent tool for exploratory data analysis.
