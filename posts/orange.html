<p>26 October 2023</p>
<p>One of my colleagues told me a couple of weeks back that he and his team were interested in 
  <a href="https://github.com/biolab/orange3">Orange</a> and asked us for opinion. I have installed it
  on my computer this week and played with it a little bit.</p>
<p>Orange can be used as a Python library for data analytics, but to be honest, if you have already 
  worked in data science, then I do not find much value of it on that as there are many excellent
  libraries on data analytics such as pandas and scikit-learn etc.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Orange works as an excellent visualization tool via orange-canvas. 
  It provides an integrated platform for data preprocessing, data analytics, model training and evaluation, visualization with a large set of widgets. One can construct his work pipeline super easily with these widgets, just like kids playing legos. Some tutorial videos can be found at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLmNPvQr9Tf-ZSDLwOzxpvY-HrE0yv-8Fy">Orange data Mining.</a></p>
<p>Moreover, Orange provides a bunch of add-ons such as Educational, Image Analytics, Text, 
  Textable, Explain (for XAI), so one can easily set up his own pipeline for data science projects in NLP 
  and Image Processing etc, although I am not sure yet how to incorporate Orange and LLM at the moment.</p>
<p>It is definitely an excellent tool for exploratory data analysis.</p>
